🎨 Hero Section:
Create an animated, parallax landing experience with smooth, cinematic transitions and minimalistic, clean graphic design.

The hero section should feature:

My circular profile image

My name (Kisan Rai)

My title (Full-Stack Software Developer)

A brief animated tagline

Use layered parallax movement for the background, text, and image to give depth and motion.

Integrate fluid typography animations with modern, cinematic fonts like Satoshi, Space Grotesk, or Poppins.

🖥️ About Me Section:
The current plain text layout is too static — transform it into a visually appealing, interactive section.

Add:

Vector icons and illustrations that reflect my personality and skills

Interactive, animated elements for a more engaging user experience

Optionally, incorporate a Bento grid-style layout (Bento Box) for neatly organized, fun, clickable info blocks.

Keep the design clean, modern, and minimalistic with subtle animations.

💼 Experience Section:
Redesign this section with dynamic visual storytelling:

Replace plain text with animated cards, timelines, or interactive visual panels

Use icons, logos, and simple illustrations to represent each job role

Consider adding Three.js-powered 3D visual effects or interactive panels to make the section engaging and memorable.

📁 Projects Section:
For each project, include:

A dummy image or placeholder graphic

Animated hover effects on each project card

Project title, brief description, and a GitHub link icon

Layout should be responsive, clean, and visually engaging, with consistent spacing and alignment.

🛠️ Skills Section:
Use appropriate, accurate vector icons for every listed technical skill.

Avoid generic or misrepresented icons — carefully match icons to:

Languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, HTML, CSS)

Frameworks (Django, Flask, Spring Boot)

Databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Tools (Docker, GitHub, AWS, Firebase)

Animate icons on hover for a polished, modern look.

💬 Chatbot Section:
Implement a simple interactive chatbot widget on the site.

Capabilities should include:

Responding with “My name is Kisan Rai”

Providing my email

Sharing my phone number (437-661-0038)

Sending my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kisanrai/

Sharing my GitHub link: https://github.com/Kisan303

Answering basic questions like “How can I contact you?” or “Where can I see your projects?”

Keep the chatbot lightweight, clean, and styled consistently with the site’s minimalist aesthetic.
