🎨 Hero Section:
Create an animated, parallax landing experience with smooth, cinematic transitions and minimalistic, clean graphic design.

The hero section should feature:

My circular profile image

My name (Kisan Rai)

My title (Full-Stack Software Developer)

A brief animated tagline

Use layered parallax movement for the background, text, and image to give depth and motion.

Integrate fluid typography animations with modern, cinematic fonts like Satoshi, Space Grotesk, or Poppins.

🖥️ About Me Section:
The current plain text layout is too static — transform it into a visually appealing, interactive section.

Add:

Vector icons and illustrations that reflect my personality and skills

Interactive, animated elements for a more engaging user experience

Optionally, incorporate a Bento grid-style layout (Bento Box) for neatly organized, fun, clickable info blocks.

Keep the design clean, modern, and minimalistic with subtle animations.

💼 Experience Section:
Redesign this section with dynamic visual storytelling:

Replace plain text with animated cards, timelines, or interactive visual panels

Use icons, logos, and simple illustrations to represent each job role

Consider adding Three.js-powered 3D visual effects or interactive panels to make the section engaging and memorable.

📁 Projects Section:
For each project, include:

A dummy image or placeholder graphic

Animated hover effects on each project card

Project title, brief description, and a GitHub link icon

Layout should be responsive, clean, and visually engaging, with consistent spacing and alignment.

🛠️ Skills Section:
Use appropriate, accurate vector icons for every listed technical skill.

Avoid generic or misrepresented icons — carefully match icons to:

Languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, HTML, CSS)

Frameworks (Django, Flask, Spring Boot)

Databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Tools (Docker, GitHub, AWS, Firebase)

Animate icons on hover for a polished, modern look.

hatbot Section:
Integrate a simple, lightweight chatbot widget styled to match the site’s minimalist, clean aesthetic.

The chatbot will feature predefined, hardcoded answers to common questions — no AI or dynamic backend needed.

Capabilities should include:

Responding with hardcoded answers such as:

“What’s your name?” → "My name is Kisan Rai."

“What’s your email?” → "You can reach me at [kisanrai939@gmail.com]."

“What’s your phone number?” → "437-661-0038"

“Where can I find your LinkedIn?” → https://www.linkedin.com/in/kisanrai/

“Where’s your GitHub?” → https://github.com/Kisan303
"For resume": https://github.com/Kisan303/Kisan-Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/Resources/Resume.pdf

Basic conversational responses like:

“Tell me about yourself.” → "I’m Kisan Rai, a passionate Full-Stack Software Developer creating seamless user experiences and solving real-world problems through technology."

“Where can I see your projects?” → "Check them out on my GitHub!"

The chatbot should:

Appear on every page as a small, accessible floating button or icon.

Use smooth fade-in and pop-up animations when opened.

Use clear, legible fonts and icons that match the overall typography and iconography of the portfolio.
