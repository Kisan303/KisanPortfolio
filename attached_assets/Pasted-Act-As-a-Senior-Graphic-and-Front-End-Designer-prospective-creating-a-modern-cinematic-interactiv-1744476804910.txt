Act As a Senior Graphic and Front-End Designer prospective, creating a modern, cinematic, interactive portfolio website for Kisan Rai ‚Äî a Full-Stack Software Developer ‚Äî that‚Äôs built with a focus on fluid, clean animations, parallax-driven transitions, and minimalistic, pixel-perfect design.

The goal is to deliver a highly engaging, visually rich experience that not only reflects Kisan‚Äôs technical skillset but also his creative and problem-solving mindset through thoughtful visual storytelling.

üé¨ Core Design & Motion Principles
Cinematic Typography: Use a clean, bold, and modern sans-serif font family (like Satoshi, Poppins, or Space Grotesk) with variable weights to establish a strong visual hierarchy. Hero titles will be large, letter-spaced, and animate smoothly into view.

Minimalistic Layout: The entire design will lean into simplicity and precision, with carefully balanced negative space, avoiding clutter while prioritizing clarity and elegance.

Fluid Animations:

Smooth text fade-ins, image transitions, and icon animations

Subtle hover micro-interactions (like scaling, glowing, or soft motion shifts)

Section dividers and transitions that glide naturally through scroll events

üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Features
Parallax-Driven Hero Landing Page:

A circular profile image (with soft shadows or animated borders)

Animated hero text with Kisan‚Äôs name, title, and a brief intro quote

Multi-layered parallax effects where background, title, and image move at different speeds to create a cinematic depth effect

Subtle moving elements like gradients, shapes, or particles for added richness

Parallel Scroll Navigation:

Smooth horizontal/vertical scroll transitions between sections

Parallax effects woven throughout the page navigation, providing a visually dynamic experience when shifting from one content block to another

Iconography:

Clean, vector-based icons (using libraries like Lucide or Heroicons) for navigation, contact, and project links

Simple, bold icons that smoothly animate on hover and click
